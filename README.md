# ALMS
•INTRODUCTION 1.1 OBJECTIVE AND GOAL OF THE PROJECT For millions of people in the developing countries,food wastage happens not only chronic poverty,conflicts and economic shocks are the reason for the hunger worldwide.Food loss also represents a waste of the very resources like land land, water and energy that are used to produce food. So in order to help people with hunger in order to reduce the hunger and the food wastage issue to an extent the idea of Alms. 








1.2 PROBLEMSTATEMENT 2 Out of our research we found foodwastage is a major issue in India which is again one of the root causes of hunger. Hunger has been a major issue for ages. So this project feeds people with hunger not only people but also animals . But why should people donate? And the answer is they don’t need to buy anything to donate, people can donate what is not needed for them(like in restaurants people order food and eat a little, the remains can be donated) and can gain through coupons after they donate. Not only food but also clothes, books etc. The product is being developed from a mere idea to reduce food wastage in the society and extended to accept any donation that can help the needy

1. Hardware components and working
ELEMENTS USED IN THE CIRCUIT PREPARATION. i)LM358 op-Amp :- Wide supply ranges, low supply current drain, supply voltage independence, and a large unity gain bandwidth are among these qualities.




ii)5V relay:- We utilised a +5V DC supply to one end of the coil and a switch to ground the other end because the relay has a 5V trigger voltage.33 k ohm , 68 k ohm, 100 k ohm, 560 ohm, 220 ohm




iii)2n22 transistor:- A transistor is a semiconductor device that can conduct as well as insulate electrical current or voltage. A transistor is a switch and an amplifier in one.




iv)10K potentiometer:- When a potentiometer is connected in a circuit and the null point is reached, it draws no current. As a result, it determines the cell's e.m.f. A potentiometer can be used to accurately measure extremely small p.d. that a voltmeter cannot measure. Using a very long wire and a very slight potential gradient, this can be accomplished.




v) 1n4007 diode:- Diodes aid in the execution of digital logic. They're used to isolate signals from a power source.

vi)100 pf capacitor:- In a DC circuit, the capacitor operates as an open switch once it has been charged with the applied voltage.

viii)555 IC Transmitter and receiver:- for transmitting and receiving the signals

ix)(IR sensor):- for sensing the objects coming near the bin to donate or disperse.

x)Servo motor 5V:- A rotary actuator or linear actuator is a servo motor. It enables accurate angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration control. It is made of an appropriate motor and a position feedback sensor.

xi)9v or 5v power supply:- for the working of the circuit.

2. Software requirements



Platforms:Flutter,Android studio. Language:html,java,php,mysql. Database:Mysql

3. How to implement the code



Website

Download and install xampp into your desktop 2.run the apache and MySQL methods in xampp
Open the login.html using browser and its done as all the navigations has been connected to the code.
APP

Download and install vscode
In vscode install the plug-in named flutter
Copy paste the flutter code that has been given in the files section and execute it.
Download the .apk for mobile use





A video link of both software and hardware has been shared for your understanding of their working along with explanation of why we have chosen the project and those materials for making up the project
